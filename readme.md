# FCGen - Fake Content Generation

The goal of this module is to provide a basis for generating real-seeming content in a manner which is consistent and customizable.

## Intended Usage

This module is not designed to be used on its own. It extends migrate so that you as the end user can create migrations which are based off of fake sources,
so that you can create test content that accurately represents your use cases.

The reason behind this is so that a site can be tested with large amounts of real content, for performance and load testing.

## Notes

* This is a work in progress, and has not been thoroughly tested.
